Internship Task 01 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression | SkillCraft Technology
# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my internship with **SkillCraft Technology** under the Task ID `SCT_ML_01`. It predicts house sale prices based on features like land area, living area, number of bedrooms, and more using a **Linear Regression model**.

## 📚 Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data manipulation  
- `numpy` – for numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` – for plotting graphs  
- `scikit-learn` – for machine learning algorithms

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset used was synthetically generated to reflect realistic housing data. It includes:

- LotArea: Size of the lot
- GrLivArea: Above-ground living area
- OverallQual: Overall material quality
- GarageArea: Garage size in sq. ft.
- Bedroom: Number of bedrooms
- YearBuilt: Year the house was built
- SalePrice: The target value (price)

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Linear Regression**
- Dataset was scaled using `StandardScaler`
- Data was split: 80% for training, 20% for testing
